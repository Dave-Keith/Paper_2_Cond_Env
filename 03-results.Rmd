# RESULTS {#ref-results}

SC in May on Georges Bank ranged from `r signif(min(cond.list$aug$Condition),digits=3)` to `r signif(max(cond.list$aug$Condition),digits=3)` grams during the study period (Figure XX). The annual SC time series shows no long term trend since 1998, although condition has been above average since 2012 (Figure XXX).   

The strongest evidence of a relationship between current SC and cumulative monthly averaged SST is during the winter and early spring period and includes cumulative SST in both the current and the previous year (Figure 3a). There is no evidence of a direct relationship between SC and cumulative monthly averaged CHL or the average MLD in the current or previous year (Figure 3b,c). The peak $R^2$ estimates are observed when looking at the cumulative average SST from January to April in the previous year; while in the current year the strongest relationship is observed for the cumulative average SST from January to March.  Models were developed based on these results and the known timing of the increase in scallop condition during the winter and early spring.  The model terms included the cumulative monthly average SST from the previous January to April ($SST_{last}$) and the cumulative monthly average SST January to March of the current year ($SST_{cur}$).  For CHL the cumulative monthly averages between January to March of the current year were used, while for MLD the average monthly mixed layer depth between January and March of the current year was used.

Both forward and backward model selection using AICc identified the model with an additive effect of $SST_{last}$, $SST_{cur}$ and MLD as the most parsimonious model (Equation 1; the $Base$ model).  Higher SST in the winter and early spring in both the current and previous year along with a deeper mixed layer are consistently associated with higher condition in the summer of the current year.  A 1&deg;C increase in the cumulative monthly average SST in January to April of the previous year is associated with a `r last.effect` ($se =$ `r last.effect.sd`) gram increase in condition. The same increase in SST from January to March of the current year is associated with an increase in condition of `r cur.effect` ($se =$ `r cur.effect.sd`) grams.  A 1 meter increase in the average depth of the mixed layer during January to March is associated with a `r mld.effect` ($se =$ `r mld.effect.sd`) gram increase in condition.

## Predictive SC Models

The $Base$ model outperforms the $SST$ model, the $AR(1)$ model, and the $NULL$ model in terms of $R^2$ and $MAPE$, however, the $SST$ model is also a significant improvement over the current $AR(1)$ methodology and the $NULL$ model (Table 1; Figures 5 and 6). The $Base$ model explains `r Final.table$R_squared[1]*100`\% of the variance in condition, the $SST$ model explains `r Final.table$R_squared[2]*100`\%, while the $AR(1)$ model explains just `r Final.table$R_squared[3]*100`\%. The $Base$ model $MAPE$ is  the lowest of the models with a reduction in the predictive error of `r -signif(Final.table$Percent.MAPE.decline[1],digits=2)`\%, however, the predictive error from the $SST$ model is also a significant improvement over the $AR(1)$ model and the $NULL$ models (Table 1; Figures 5 and 6).


There were an additional 3 years of SST data which were not included in the original model as the MLD was unavailable for these years (2016-2018); these data were used to further test the predictive skill of the $NULL$, $AR(1)$, and $SST$ models.  The $SST$ model ($MAPE =$  `r signif(MAPE.new.data.table$MAPE[3],digits =2)`) outperformed both the $NULL$ model and the $AR(1)$ model ($MAPE =$  `r signif(MAPE.new.data.table$MAPE[2],digits =2)` for both models);  the $SST$ model provided improved predictions in 2 of the 3 years (Figure 6b-d).
