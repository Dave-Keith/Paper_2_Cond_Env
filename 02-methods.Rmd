## Study area

Georges Bank (GB) is a large elevated area of seafloor located in the Gulf of Maine between Massachusetts and Nova Scotia (Figure 1).  It is one of the most physically energetic and biologically productive oceanic regions and has supported commercial fisheries for centuries [@townsendNitrogenLimitationSecondary1997]. The primary production cycle on GB is highly seasonal, and typically exhibits a pronounced late winter-early spring bloom [@townsendOceanographyNorthwestAtlantic2006]. GB is dominated by tidal mixing currents throughout most of its area, especially in the central shallow region on the top of the bank (inside the 60 m isobath), where the waters remain vertically homogeneous under the influence of tidal mixing throughout the year [@townsendNitrogenLimitationSecondary1997; @townsendOceanographyNorthwestAtlantic2006]. 

## Scallop Survey
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has been conducting annual scallop surveys on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank since 1981. The annual dredge survey is conducted on GB every August; the survey uses a 2.44 m New Bedford style scallop dredge with a 38 mm polypropylene liner. The survey collects detailed meat weight and shell height data for an average of 2011 scallop each year (range from 539-6548 samples; note that the sampling intensity increased in 2010).  Scallop condition (SC) is calculated using the weights of the sampled meat and the associated shell heights; SC is then used to develop a biomass index. Complete details of sampling design and modelling methodology can be found in @hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014.

## Satellite Observed and Ocean Model Data

The satellite remote sensed and model data was subset to the Canadian portion of Georges Bank with depths shallower than 120 m; this Georges Bank domain includes all of the primary scallop habitat on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank (Figure 1). The 120 m bathymetric contour was extracted from the ETOPO5 database [@noaaDataAnnouncement88MGG021988, https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo5.HTML].  The total area within the Georges Bank domain was approximately 6,500 km^2^.

### Sea surface temperature

Monthly sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Aqua Earth-observing satellite (Aqua MODIS) were downloaded from the NASA ocean-color website (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), from August 2002 to August 2018 with a 4 km resolution. SST data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) pathfinder version 5.2 (PFV5.2) were downloaded from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory archive (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov) for the time period of January 1998 to December 2009 with a 4 km resolution. The overlapping period between AVHRR pathfinder and MODIS SST data, from August 2002 to December 2009 was used to compare both data sets and revealed a difference of less than 0.2$^{\circ}$C. Given the consistency in SST estimates between these data sources the AVHRR pathfinder SST from  January 1998-December 2008 was combined with the MODIS SST from January 2009-August 2018. The SST data were spatially averaged over the domain to provide one mean value per month, resulting in 248 monthly SST estimates.

### Ocean Bottom Temperatures

Average monthly bottom temperatures (BT) were obtained from BNAM.  Get details of the BNAM data.


## Condition-Environment Correlation

The strength of the relationship between SC in August of a given year and SST and BT were assessed using the monthly environmental data.  To investigate the influence of past environmental conditions on SC the relationship between SC and each environmental covariate was investigated at time lags of up to 32 months; for example the relationship between SC in 2015 was compared with each monthly SST estimate between January 2013 to July of 2015.  Whereas, the cumulative effect of each environmental covariate on SC was assessed as the sum of the monthly estimates; for example, the SC in August of 2015 was compared to the sum of the monthly SST estimates between January 2013 and July 2015. 

The strength of the relationship between the environmental covariate and SC was assessed using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) from a simple linear model and the correlation using the non-parametric Kendall's $\tau$-value [@kendallNewMeasureRank1938]. The result of these analyses are large matrices of $R^2$ and $\tau$ values for each of the environmental covariates.  There was little effect of any environmental covariate at lags greater than 20 months (i.e. SC in the current year is not correlated with any of the environmental covariates at lags longer than January of the previous year); therefore, only the results from January of the previous year to July of the current year are discussed.  Additionally,  the interpretation of the Kendall's $\tau$ and $R^2$ results were similar so only the $R^2$ results are discussed further. 

## Condition Modelling

The results of the correlation analysis and documented increase in scallop condition in the spring in this region [@thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014] led to the decision to use cumulative SST from January to April of the previous year ($SST_{last}$).  The Bottom Temperature from BNAM was TAKEN FOR WHICH MONTHS



\begin{equation}  SC_{i} = SST_{last} + SST_{cur} + \epsilon_i    \end{equation}

The $Base$ model includes MLD which comes from an oceanographic model.  Thee data are generally not available when the predictions of SC are required for stock assessment purposes, therefore, a $SST$ model (Equation 2), which uses only remotely sensed data that are available in near real time, was evaluated.


\begin{equation}  SC_{i} = SST_{last} + SST_{cur} + \epsilon_i    \end{equation}

The currently adopted assessment methodology uses condition from the previous year to predict condition in the following year [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. This approach was formalized as a first order auto-regressive model ($AR(1)$ model; Equation 3) in order to compare the current methodology with the other models.


\begin{equation} SC_{i} = SC_{last} + \epsilon_i    \end{equation}

The final model was a simple $NULL$ model which includes only an intercept term representing the mean SC ($SC_{mean}$) for the time series (1999-2015; Equation 4); this model was used as a baseline to compare against the more complex models.  


\begin{equation} SC_{i} =  SC_{mean} + \epsilon_i    \end{equation}



## Condition Model Predictive Error

Cross validation was performed to assess the predictive ability of each model (i.e. the model's ability to predict new observations).  For each simulation 4 years of data were excluded and the models were fit using the remaining data.  These models were then used to predict the condition for the 4 randomly selected years which were excluded from the model; for the $AR(1)$ model the condition from the year before the excluded year was used to predict the condition.  For each simulation the difference between the model predicted and the actual observed condition for the 4 years was calculated using the mean absolute predictive error ($MAPE$; Equation 5).  This procedure was repeated `r n.boots` times and provided a distribution of $MAPE$ estimates for each of the models. 


\begin{equation} MAPE = \frac{100}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\mid Obs_i - Pred_i \mid }{Obs_i} \end{equation}

In addition to this simulation, the three additional years of data (2016-2018) which were available for SST and SC were used to compare the $SST$, $AR(1)$, and $NULL$ models. These three models (using the model results obtained from fitting to the data from 1999-2015) were used to generate predictions of scallop condition from 2016-2018.  The predictions for each of the models was compared with the observed SC during these three years using $MAPE$ to quantify the ability of each model to predict future scallop condition.
