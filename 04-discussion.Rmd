# Discussion 

The meat weight observed on Georges Bank for a 100 mm shell height scallop (i.e. scallop condition) has varied by XXX grams over the time series, but inter-annual variability alone has been as large as XXX grams; this corresponds to a maximum inter-annual percentage change in SC of XXX%. The incorporation of environmental data from the winter and spring period significantly improves the modelling and prediction of SC compared to the existing method.  Despite this, the incorporation of this environmental relationship into the existing stock assessment framework has little effect on the biomass predictions for the upcoming year. This is due to a small positive bias in the biomass predictions for the upcoming year in the existing predictive model. This positive bias is likely due to the model over-estimating other productivity parameters. These results highlight the challenges of using quantitative environmental relationships in existing stock assessment frameworks to provide environmentally-conditioned advice within an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management framework. 

While examples of relationships between environmental conditions and some metric of productivity (recruitment, growth, natural mortality) are plentiful (CITATIONS), the incorporation of these relationships into the science advice for fisheries management advice has often proven challenging. The relationships observed often change over time, or break down completely, making it challenging to use for science advice [CITE MORE!! @myersWhenEnvironmentRecruitment1998]. In other circumstances the environment-productivity relationship may not be relevant to the stock assessment framework itself, for example, identifying a relationship between larval survival and temperature, while ecologically of interest, will have little impact on the stock assessment if an index of juvenile recruitment is available and used in the provision of science advice.  Another challenge is the availability of the necessary data, science advice is often required on a regular pre-determined schedule,  but if the environmental data necessary to inform the stock assessment is not available until after the science advice is provided there is no means of using the relationship in the provision of the science advice. Indeed, of the more successful applications utilizing environmental information into science advice only does so indirectly and does not directly rely on the observed relationship, but instead the productivity parameter (natural mortality) was allowed to vary over time rather than directly attempting to model the environmental-productivity relationship directly in the model [@swainExtremeIncreasesNatural2015].

These finding underpin three questions that should be considered at the outset of any project by stakeholders interested in development of environmentally-conditioned science advice for real time management: 1) how does the environmental relationship being explored potentially influence the science advice, is a qualitative sufficient or do you need a quantitative indicator (*Advice criterion*) 2) could the environmental relationship improve the estimation or prediction of an aspect of productivity over the current methodology (*predictive criterion*), and 3) will the required environmental data be available when the science advisory process is undertaken (*availability criterion*).

# Advice Criterion

How the relationship under study influences the Science Advice should be considered when investigating potential relationships

Here we show how even when a strong predictive relationship is observed it does not necessarily improve the quantiative Science Advice. If goal of a project is to improve quantitative science advice, simulation work should be undertaken before a project is undertaken to understand how improved understanding of the variable in question could change provided science advice.  

That said, this relationship can be used contextually to indicate years to identify years in which condition is expected to be good/bad.  So it's not useless, but if you are going to go out and spend a bazillon dollars, it would be worth knowing if your indicator is going to directly or indirectly impact your science advice.


# Predictive Criterion

There are a myriad of environmental variables that correlate in some way to metrics of productivity for many marine species (CITATIONS).   It has long been recognized that these relationship often break down over time and the use of environmental data in stock assessments has remained limited.   For sea scallop, the large changes in SC both inter and intra-annual can lead to rapid changes in the biomass of the population (CITATIONS) *so it's not like this is some un-important variable*.

The interaction between the assessment model and the EV-productivity relationship should be given more consideration during the development of projects such as this. There has been an implicit assumption that quantitatively accounting for EVs within an assessment will improve science advice. Here we have shown that even with a very clear relationship between an EV and productivity this is not necessarily the case.When attempting to incorporate EAFM considerations into a traditional stock assessment model, simulation studies should first be undertaken to understand how a particular EV could be used within a traditional framework and to quantify the potential impact of the EV in the assessment.  If we really want to do EAFM (and beyond) then research to develop Next-Generation Stock Assessment methods that can integrate ecosystem considerations directly into the model framework should be a high priority. 

# Availability 

There are a whole bunch of other potential environmental indicators (e.g. oceanographic model indicators) that could be used.  For example, oceanographic bottom temperature also improves the SC estimates, but unfortunately the data isn't available in real time and thus cannot be incorporated into the science advice process.  
Need to think about this when doing this shit.


In the stock assessment process, environmental data can be incorporated to better understand the underlying processes driving patterns in a time series, but simply incorporating these relationships into traditional assessment frameworks may not improve science advice.  

These challenges suggest that in the near term the most useful path forward for utilizing environmental data may be to use it for strategic longer-term planning, for example to predict impacts of climate change (although extrapolating relationships to unobserved ecosystems states has its own suite of challenges).  In the longer-term, to achieve EAFM/EBFM/EBM goals it will require new stock assessment modelling frameworks in which the environmental considerations are intrinsically linked into the assessment [PUNT/CADRIN/MAYBE LINK?].  A first step in this direction is Raph’s spatial paper in which spatial variability it accounted for in the assessment.  While this doesn’t account for environmental effects in the traditional sense, the spatial variability modelled through this method is integrating productivity changes due to environmental variability.  This and other next-generation stock assessment methods will likely need to be developed before we are able to have tactical in-year science advice that is fully informed by environmental and ecosystem considerations [PUNT]

## Conclusion

The integration of oceanographic and environmental data in stock assessment advice is critical to implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) and is required to inform climate-ready fisheries management strategies [@wilsonAdaptiveComanagementAchieve2018]. The results of this study show how the combination of environmental covariates with traditional fisheries survey data can improve our understanding of the influence of the environment on an aspect of scallop productivity. Unfortunately, these results also highlight the challenges of integrating these relationships into the existing stock assessment processes.

The integration of stock assessment and EAFM research is needed to develop products and stock assessment models that can help move us towards EAFM/EBFM/EBM objectives, the time of the two solitudes must end.

There is often a disconnect between stock assessment research and EAFM research, if the integration of ecological information into science advice is to be successful, then the barriers between these two fields of research need to be eliminated so we no longer have the two solitudes.

Conventional sampling methods using research vessels are limited in space and time with fishery surveys and in-situ oceanographic sampling occurring at most a few times a year. In contrast, satellite remote sensing and oceanographic modelling outputs provides near continuous, high spatio-temporal environmental data; although, only remote sensed data products are available in near real time. While the overall best model incorporates both SST and MLD, this relationship cannot be operationalized because of the limitations on the *availability* of the MLD data. However, the *SST* model also improves the *prediction* of SC over the current biological-only methodology and these data are *available* in near real time. The *SST* model meets both the *predictive* and the *availability criteria* and this relationship can be operationalized within the stock assessment process to help improve science advice.


 # STUFF TO ADD IN


This is due to the relatively small bias in the biomass predictions from the model due to an over-estimate of other productivity parameters and a slight under-prediction of condition using the current method. 

There is a laundry list of environmental variables that correlate in some way to metrics of productivity for numerous stocks.  It has long been recognized that these relationship often break down over time and the use of environmental data in stock assessments has remained limited.  Unfortunately, we show how even when the relationship holds, it does not necessarily lead to better science advice.  And it’s not like condition doesn’t matter, it can lead to swings in biomass of up to 30% year over year.   

An additionally challenge that has received less attention is the practical challenge of implementation of these data into traditional stock assessments. Given the availability of the SST data in near real time, this should facilitate it’s use in the stock assessment process.  But, in this case, the SST in Jan-March is required to predict condition for the current year so even with this near real time availability of this data its use for tactical science advice for the current year is challenging and this relationship would serve no benefit if the science advice is required before this data is available.  The situation is more problematic for modelled oceanographic data which is not available in near real time and would rarely be available in time to inform science advice.   

These challenges suggest that in the near term the most useful path forward for utilizing environmental data may be to use it for strategic longer-term planning, for example to predict impacts of climate change (although extrapolating relationships to unobserved ecosystems states has its own suite of challenges).  In the longer-term, to achieve EAFM/EBFM/EBM goals it will require new stock assessment modelling frameworks in which the environmental considerations are intrinsically linked into the assessment (Punt).  A first step in this direction is Raph’s spatial paper in which spatial variability it accounted for in the assessment.  While this doesn’t account for environmental effects in the traditional sense, the spatial variability modelled through this method is integrating productivity changes due to environmental variability.  This and other next-gen stock assessment methods will likely need to be developed before we are able to have tactical in-year science advice that is fully informed by environmental and ecosystem considerations (Punt paper). 

<!-- The implications of this change on stock assessment advice is significant since SC is assumed as a known input and is currently assumed unchanged from the previous year for biomass projections, from which fisheries management decisions on removal levels are made [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014;@dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. Model projections based on underestimates of SC will therefore inherently underestimate biomass and may result in economic loss, whereas overestimates of SC will overestimate biomass leading to an increased risk of over-exploitation, all else being equal.   -->

<!-- Through correlation analysis, cumulative SST was identified as most correlated with SC at the time of the survey in August. The periods of strongest correlation with SST were observed during January to April of the previous year and January to March of the current year. The observation that summer SC is correlated with this winter-spring period is supported by the annual cyclical nature of energy storage and utilization of  *P. magellanicus* [@naiduReproductionBreedingCycle1970; @sarroSpatialTemporalVariation2009; @thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014]. However, unexpectedly, SC did not show strong correlation with CHL or MLD, although further empirical modelling indicated that MLD did significantly improve the SC estimates (*Base* model). The *Base* model (covariates of SST and MLD) explained `r 100*Final.table*R_squared[1]`% and the *SST* model (SST only) explained `r 100*Final.table*R_squared[2]`% of the variance in SC between years, compared to just `r 100*Final.table*R_squared[3]`% using the *AR(1)* model; the latter is based on biological sampling alone and is the current adopted form for providing predictions on SC in stock assessments [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. 

 Although sea scallops exhibit an annual cyclical nature to their energy cycle, the results of the SST correlation analysis, *Base*, *SST*, and *AR(1)* models all support the notion that scallop condition is dependent on the cumulative environmental conditions experienced in the winter and spring period leading up to spawning and that this effect is not fully lost during spawning. Therefore, the condition of the scallop meat in August appears dependent on the environmental conditions up to 20 months prior. 

We found no evidence for a relationship between CHL and SC which was surprising given the role of phytoplankton in scallop diets  [@shumwayFoodResourcesRelated1987; @macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. Clearance rates in *P. magellanicus* are positively correlated to temperature [@macdonaldFeedingActivityScallops2009], however they have been shown to be independent across a broad range of food concentrations  [@cranfordParticleClearanceAbsorption1990; @macdonaldVariationFoodQuality1994; @cranfordSituFeedingAbsorption1998] and may decline at high food concentrations [@grantSedimentResuspensionRates1997].  Our results, combined with the strong mixing and high primary productivity that characterizes Georges Bank [@townsendNitrogenLimitationSecondary1997; @townsendOceanographyNorthwestAtlantic2006], suggests that food availability may not limit growth and thus scallop condition on Georges Bank. Alternatively, phytoplankton blooms are generally of short duration and do not cover the entire domain used in this study; the lack of evidence for an effect of CHL may therefore be due to the aggregation of the data in both space (6,500 km^2^) and time (monthly average) used in this study [@songPhenologyPhytoplanktonBlooms2010] (**CJ and ED can you provide a reference here and what do we mean by short duration, size of typical bloom etc??**). Further research at a finer spatio-temporal scale that more closely matches the scale of the phytoplankton blooms may better resolve this relationship.

***Catherine/Emmanuel – a oceanographic paragraph to link SST, MLD, CHL and below observations:*** The increase in SC with increasing MLD (Base model) indicates that increased connectivity (mixing) between the surface and benthic communities generally leads to elevated condition SST direction with SC link to oceanography paragraph by CJ and ED.  link to oceanography paragraph by CJ and ED

**Is this a reasonable summary of Brickman, especially the effect about Temp anomalies being relatively uniform from surface to depth, ideas for other references?**
Within the SST range observed over the last two decades, SC improved when the SST in the spring was elevated and this effect was amplified when SST was elevated for consecutive years. The temperatures in the region have increased over the last decade, this has been driven by an increase in the occurrence of high salinity warm water eddies forming at the tail of the Grand Banks  [@brickmanMechanismRecentOcean2018]. These anomalous eddies propagate across the Scotian Shelf to the Gulf of Maine and are caused by an interaction between the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream. Similar cold water eddies were likely more common in previous decades and appear to help regulate temperatures within the region during colder periods [@brickmanMechanismRecentOcean2018].  Within both cold and warm eddies the MLD would likely be above average and temperature anomalies are observed from near the surface to depths in excess of 120 meters. The SST anomaly would be correlated to the bottom temperature anomaly at the depths scallop inhabit on Georges Bank within an eddy which indicates that SST could be a good proxy for the environment scallop experience.  These eddies have a central role in modulating temperatures on Georges Bank and throughout the region, and therefore on the environmental conditions scallop experience.

Scallop meat weight declines rapidly in the fall and this decline is associated with the primary spawning event which generally begins in August and ends in October or November on Georges Bank [@posgayObservationSpawningSea1958; @naiduReproductionBreedingCycle1970; @thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014].  After spawning, scallop meat weight remains low until the winter, at which time the meat weight begins to increase and generally reaches a maximum by June; meat weight then remains similar until spawning and the cycle begins again [@macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985a; @sarroSpatialTemporalVariation2009; @thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014]. The increase in scallop meat weight is a gradual process, taking up to half a year [@sarroSpatialTemporalVariation2009]; therefore, identifying the environmental attributes that most influence scallop productivity requires continuous environmental data such that the effect of integrated environmental conditions can be evaluated.
