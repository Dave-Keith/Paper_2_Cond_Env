# INTRODUCTION {#ref-intro}


There is an urgent need to sustainably manage fish stocks due to pressures from over-fishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change [@faoStateWorldFisheries2018]. While it is well known that oceanographic conditions influence natural fluctuations in fish stocks, disentangling environmental variability from fishing effects remains challenging,  often due to the non-stationarity of the relationships and a lack of scientific resources [@myersWhenEnvironmentRecruitment1998; @skern-mauritzenEcosystemProcessesAre2016]. For this reason stock assessment methods historically only directly account for the effects of population demographics and fishing while ignoring environmental effects outright [@skern-mauritzenEcosystemProcessesAre2016]. More recently, methods have been developed which indirectly account for environmental variability by allowing for model parameters to vary over time [@swainExtremeIncreasesNatural2015]  but the integration of environmental data directly into traditional stock assessment models remains the exception [@cadrinStockAssessmentMethods2015]. Improved understanding of the influence of environmental variation on fish populations dynamics would  improve science advice within an ecosystem context and help operationalize an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Further, climate and environmental considerations are increasingly required in fisheries management decision making in order to mitigate, adapt, and respond to the impacts of climate change [@wilsonAdaptiveComanagementAchieve2018; @ActAmendFisheries2019].   

Fisheries management decisions often include setting removals limits in terms of biomass;  however, these decision are complicated by fluctuations in stock size due to variable recruitment, growth, condition, and survival all of which are influenced by the environment. For the world’s largest wild scallop fisheries, the sea scallop (*Placopecten magellanicus*) found off the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, reliable indices of recruitment are available through fishery independent surveys; however, outside of major recruitment events, annual variations in growth underlie major fluctuations in catch rate and yield. In Canada, the scallop adductor muscle is the harvested part of the scallop, with landings reported and managed (e.g. Total Allowable Catch (TAC)) in terms of the biomass (weight) of the adductor meat (muscle).

Growth is an integrated response of energy acquisition and expenditure. For scallop, growth can be defined either in terms of an increase in some dimension of the shell or in terms of the change in the soft tissue [@macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. Shell growth continues as scallops age and generally the adductor muscle increases with shell size; however,  the growth and size of the adductor muscle will also vary throughout the year [e.g. resorption of somatic tissue: @vahlEnergyTransformationsIceland1981; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985]. For *P. magellanicus*, intra-annual changes in the meat weight for the same shell height are characterized by increases in weight in late winter and early spring and declines during spawning in the late summer and early fall [@naiduReproductionBreedingCycle1970; @robinsonSeasonalChangesSoftbody1981; @thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014]. This seasonal pattern is attributed to gametogenesis and the buildup of energy reserves; however, the magnitude of this cycle has been observed to vary between years within season [@robinsonSeasonalChangesSoftbody1981; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985a; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1986;@macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1987; @schickAllometricRelationshipsGrowth1992a].


Inter-annual differences in meat weight for the same shell height are likely due to environmental conditions. When seasonal patterns are controlled for, spatial and depth differences in meat weight for a given shell size are often observed; with larger meats found at shallow water depths where temperature and food availability are often more favorable [@macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1986; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1987; @schickAllometricRelationshipsGrowth1992a]. In sea scallops, food ration, consisting of suspended detrital material and phytoplankton, is a major factor in the regulation of growth and production [@cranfordParticleClearanceAbsorption1990; @shumwayFoodResourcesRelated1987; @macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. Whereas temperature is positively correlated with metabolic rate, as measured by the rate of oxygen consumption [@shumwaySeasonalChangesOxygen1988; @macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016].

The relationship between meat weight and shell height is usually defined using an allometric model [@laiLinearMixedeffectsModels2004; @hennenShellHeightToWeightRelationships2012; @sarroSpatialTemporalVariation2009] and in Canada’s Maritimes Region an allometric relationship is used to determine the meat weight of a 100 mm shell height scallop – hereafter referred to as Scallop Condition (SC).  This index is used to track inter-annual change in meat condition and yearly fluctuations in SC have been observed to be as great as 30% [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @nasmithScallopProductionAreas2016; @sameotoScallopFishingArea2015]. Better understanding and prediction of inter-annual changes in SC will facilitate the sustainable management of scallop fisheries because SC is required to estimate biomass, growth rates, and future biomass projections which are used inform catch limits [@jonsenGeorgesBankScallop2009; @hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. The current study focuses on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank which supports one of Canada’s most valuable commercial fisheries with approximately 75% of Canadian scallop landings coming from this bank [@stewartEnvironmentalRequirementsSea1994].

Management decisions for the Canadian Georges Bank sea scallop fishery are based on annual scientific surveys, with estimates from these surveys used in a Bayesian state space assessment model [@smithImpactSurveyDesign2014] to provide 1-year projections of biomass [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. The fishery runs from January to December with decisions on an interim TAC made in December of the previous year and a final TAC is set after the science assessment is complete in the spring of the current year.  The biomass projections for the current fishing year requires a prediction of SC; the current methodology assumes SC for the current year is  unchanged from the the previous year [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. Implicitly this assumes that the best predictor of future SC is the past year SC (i.e. it is an autoregressive process with a 1 year lag; AR(1)); this approach cannot account for environmental effects that may alter the condition of the scallop meat after the survey. Alternatively, a methodology that incorporates environmental effects could result in improved predictions of SC and in turn lead to more accurate biomass projections and science advice. 

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether a recently developed model that relates SC to Winter SST can be integrated into the existing stock assessment process to improve biomass estimates for sea scallop on the Canadian portion of GB. Our objectives were a) incorporate predictive SC-SST models into the biomass estimates for Geroges Bank, b) undertake a retrospective analysis to compare the predictions from these models to the predictions using the current biological-only model, c) quantify the difference in the biomass predictions from each of these models to the realized biomass, and (d) discuss the implications of these results on the science advice provided to fisheries management.
