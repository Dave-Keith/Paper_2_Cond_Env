# INTRODUCTION {#ref-intro}

There is an urgent need to sustainably manage fish stocks due to pressures from over-fishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change [@faoStateWorldFisheries2018]. While it is well known that oceanographic conditions influence natural fluctuations in fish stocks, disentangling environmental variability from fishing effects remains challenging,  often due to the non-stationarity of the relationships and a lack of scientific resources [@myersWhenEnvironmentRecruitment1998; @skern-mauritzenEcosystemProcessesAre2016]. For this reason stock assessment methods historically directly account for only the effects of population demographics and fishing while ignoring environmental effects outright [@skern-mauritzenEcosystemProcessesAre2016] and the integration of environmental data directly into traditional stock assessment models remains the exception [@cadrinStockAssessmentMethods2015]. 

Improved understanding of the influence of environmental variability on fish populations dynamics could improve science advice within an ecosystem context and help operationalize an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Further, climate and environmental considerations are increasingly required in fisheries management decision making in order to mitigate, adapt, and respond to the impacts of climate change [@wilsonAdaptiveComanagementAchieve2018; @dfoActAmendFisheries2019]. Fisheries management decisions often include setting removals limits in terms of biomass; however, these decision are complicated by fluctuations in stock size due to variability in productivity parameters such as recruitment, growth, condition, and survival; all of which are influenced by the environment. 

These environment-productivity relationships have been of interest to fisheries scientists throughout the history of the field [Other old stuff? @bevertonDynamicsExploitedFish1957;@rickerStockRecruitment1954]. The relationship between the environment and recruitment was one of the first, and is one of the more common, environmental relationships that has been explored [CITE]. However the development of long-term predictable relationships between recruitment and environmental conditions has been challenging and has limited the incorporation of these relationships into stock assessment models [@myersWhenEnvironmentRecruitment1998]. A second well studied axis of environment-productivity relationships explores how the environment effects natural mortality [CITE SOME STUFF]. The operationalization of these natural mortality-environmental relationships has been shown promise by allowing natural mortality to vary over time [@swainExtremeIncreasesNatural2015]. In part, this method has proven successful because the environmental driver was both well measured and the fluctuations from year to year were relatively predictable and the flexibility of the modelling framework which allows the productivity parameter to track the known environmental change without an explicit link between the two [@swainExtremeIncreasesNatural2015]. 

A third axis of environment-productivity relationships is related to the growth and condition of individuals within a population. Individual growth somethign something something [CITE STUFF]. A great deal of research has also been directed at understanding how fish condition is impacted by environmental varability something something something[CITE MARSHALL STUFF].  As with the environment-recruitment relationships the operationalization of these environment-growth/condition relationships into stock assessment frameworks has been the exception [DOES THAT 2015 CADRIN PAPER DO WHAT WE NEED HERE], in part due to the lack predictability of these relationships in future years.  

Recent research on Sea Scallop (*Placotpecten magellanicus*) on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank (GB) has used Satellite remote sensing data to predict the condition of scallop (i.e. meat weight of 100 mm scallops) up to 18 months into the future [@liuUsingSatelliteRemote2021]. Scallop condition (SC) was found to be highly correlated to the additive effect Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the winter of the previous year (January-March) and the winter of the current year (January-February). This method provides a means of predicting scallop condition that is required to project the biomass of the stock into future years and thus enables this relationship to be operationalized into the assessment for this stock [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. The prediction of SC presently used in this assessment uses the SC for the previous year as the predicted SC used for the model projections [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @dfoStockStatusUpdate2018]. This approach cannot account for environmental effects that may alter the condition of the scallop meat after the previous years survey estimate of SC is obtained. While this SC-SST model provides a novel means of predicting inter-annual changes in SC, it has yet to be compared to the current method used to predict SC nor has the quantitative impact of incorporating this predictive model into the stock assessment modelling framework been assessed. 

<!-- Alternatively, a methodology that incorporates environmental effects could result in improved predictions of SC and in turn lead to more accurate biomass projections and science advice.  -->

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether utilizing the predictive SC-SST model developed by @liuUsingSatelliteRemote2021 within the existing stock assessment modelling framework can be used to quantitatively improve the science advice provided to fisheries management for sea scallop on the Canadian portion of GB. Our objectives were to a) compare predictive ability of the SST-condition models with the existing method used to predict SC for the stock assessment, b) quantify the difference in the biomass predictions from these methods to the realized biomass, and (c) discuss suggested best practices when undertaking research to incorporate  environmental information into existing science advice frameworks.

<!-- Many relationships between environmental conditions and some metric of productivity (recruitment, growth, natural mortality) have been identified (CITATIONS). Unfortunately, incorporation of these relationships into the science advice for fisheries management advice has often proven challenging. The relationships observed often change over time, or break down completely, making it challenging to use for science advice (CITATIONS). In other circumstances the environment-productivity relationship may not be relevant to the stock assessment framework itself, for example, identifying a relationship between larval survival and temperature, while ecologically of interest, will have little impact on the stock assessment if an index of juvenile recruitment is available and used in the provision of science advice.  Another challenge is the availability of the necessary data, science advice is often required on a regular schedule,  but if the environmental data necessary to inform the stock assessment isn't available until after the science advice is provided what's the point. -->

<!-- Growth is an integrated response of energy acquisition and expenditure. For scallop, growth can be defined either in terms of an increase in some dimension of the shell or in terms of the change in the soft tissue [@macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. Shell growth continues as scallops age and generally the adductor muscle increases with shell size; however, the growth and size of the adductor muscle will also vary throughout the year [e.g. resorption of somatic tissue: @vahlEnergyTransformationsIceland1981; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985]. For *P. magellanicus*, intra-annual changes in the meat weight for the same shell height are characterized by increases in weight in late winter and early spring and declines during spawning in the late summer and early fall [@naiduReproductionBreedingCycle1970; @robinsonSeasonalChangesSoftbody1981; @thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014]. This seasonal pattern is attributed to gametogenesis and the buildup of energy reserves; however, the magnitude of this cycle has been observed to vary between years within season [@robinsonSeasonalChangesSoftbody1981; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985a; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1986;@macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1987; @schickAllometricRelationshipsGrowth1992a]. -->


<!-- Inter-annual differences in the weight of the adductor muscle (i.e. meat weight) for the same shell height are likely due to environmental conditions. When seasonal patterns are controlled for, spatial and depth differences in meat weight for a given shell size are often observed; with larger meats found at shallow water depths where temperature and food availability are often more favorable [@macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1985; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1986; @macdonaldInfluenceTemperatureFood1987; @schickAllometricRelationshipsGrowth1992a]. In sea scallops, food ration, consisting of suspended detrital material and phytoplankton, is a major factor in the regulation of growth and production [@cranfordParticleClearanceAbsorption1990; @shumwayFoodResourcesRelated1987; @macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. Whereas temperature is positively correlated with metabolic rate, as measured by the rate of oxygen consumption [@shumwaySeasonalChangesOxygen1988; @macdonaldPhysiologyEnergyAcquisition2016]. There are also predictable seasonal changes in meat weight; for example, on Georges Bank the meat weight increases in the late winter and early spring, likely due to increased food availability, and declines in late summer and early fall due to the energetic demands of spawning [@thompsonIdentifyingSpawningEvents2014]. -->

<!-- The relationship between meat weight and shell height is usually defined using an allometric model [@laiLinearMixedeffectsModels2004; @hennenShellHeightToWeightRelationships2012; @sarroSpatialTemporalVariation2009] and in Canada’s Maritimes Region an allometric relationship is used to determine the meat weight of a 100 mm shell height scallop – hereafter referred to as Scallop Condition (SC). This index is used to track inter-annual change in meat condition and yearly fluctuations in SC have been observed to be as great as 30% [@hubleyGeorgesBankBrowns2014; @nasmithScallopProductionAreas2016; @sameotoScallopFishingArea2015].  -->
